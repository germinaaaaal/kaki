When my heart is so light
And the sky is so green
There is no hint of dark,
there’s a long way to go.

Just like the end of time
Or a six-fingered week,
There are things that could be
And should never have been.

The present is all here,
It is all you can be:
I wish I could say why, 
but I don’t really know.

I can still look ahead,
Run my hands through the night
From the sill where I lay
I can still see the show.

Fate has not crept in yet,
The verdict is unknown,
But this present I weigh
Soon it too will be gone.

There was never a "will",
Nor ever a "who knows",
I can think of today,
But tomorrow, who knows?

In my wake now it's dim
And soon I will be too.
Every day till the day,
Time will give me a blow.

But it’s still not too late,
I can write in the dark! 
The night is clear as day,
Don’t I want you to know?

Now it's already passed,
And perhaps you will think:
"Yesterday was a blur,"
And "today" is a slur.

You are still just like me,
Still you dream at the sill,
But your sight is so near,
No-one looks far below.

One day you will look back
And not know what I know;
I know that you will say:
That's a long time ago.

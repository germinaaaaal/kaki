When my heart is so light
And the sky is so green
There is no hint of dark,
there’s a long way to go.

I can still look ahead,
Run my hands through unknowns
From the window at bay
I can still see the show.

Fate has not yet called out,
Yet the verdict is known:
All these seconds I weigh,
Soon they too will be gone.

Yesterday now is dim 
And soon I will be too.
Every day that I wait, 
Time will give me a blow.

But it’s still not too late, 
I can write in the dark!
The night is clear as day: 
Don’t I want you to know?

You are still just like me,
Blotted fingers the same,
Eyes in vertigo cry,
Don't look, don't look below.

When the sky has gone blue
Back and forth a few times,
You'll look over and sigh:
I will say to you "No". 

One day you will look back
And not know what I know;
I know that you will say:
That's a long time ago.

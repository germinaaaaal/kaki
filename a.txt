When my heart is so light
And the sky is so green
There is no hint of dark,
there’s a long way to go.

All the present is here,
It is all you can be:
I wish I could say why, 
But I don't really know.

I can still look ahead,
Run my hands through the night
From the window at bay
I can still see the show.

Fate has not yet called out,
Yet the verdict is known:
All these seconds I weigh,
Soon they too will be gone.

Yesterday now is dim
And soon I will be too.
Every day that I wait,
Time will give me a blow.

But it’s still not too late,
I can write in the dark! 
The night is clear as day,
Don’t I want you to know?

* In the blades of the grass
* Whistling in the yard,
* The sharp edge of a leaf
* Marks my finger its own.

When the sky has gone blue
Back and forth a few times,
You'll look over and sigh:
My answer will be "no". 

You are still just like me,
Still you watch at the edge,
Vertigo in your eyes,
Don't look, don't look below.

* And now as I look back
* At my wake in the grass,
* It has shut in the sways:
* The blood shed is just mine.

One day you will look back
And not know what I know;
I know that you will say:
That's a long time ago.

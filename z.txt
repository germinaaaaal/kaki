But what is there to trust?
My heartbeat 
I feel only through my hand.

And under my dark eyelids
The world is all me.
-
If I can’t close my eyes..
What will happen to me?

There are so many things
That I don't want to see;
And if I never see them
They could never be.

There was never an "inwards"
Nor ever an I,
There were only two windows
I watch you go by.

In the photo, a drawing
A hand scurried to say
This point was green, or blue,
Or often brown or grey.

And what do I have?
My body stays at the door
And will fall apart
As doomed as Yugoslavia.

When I don't pay attention
I forget to breathe,
But my breath moves without me;
What good can I be?

I cannot run away,
Room is wall-to-wall tomb
I'm in funeral garb
And the world is my womb

It says "here is a colour"
It is like all blues,
I say "this is blue" and
The sea of it moves


It says "we are here" 

It's a good thing it's here,
It can take me around,


When we have all gone home
Before silence, day will break.
Day will break 
Before the silence does
There are wars where the sun's up
What good will they make?
